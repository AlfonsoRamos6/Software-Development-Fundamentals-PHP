 # Project Overview
 
This site is a shopping cart website that sells chairs on the website. This website will be made using PHP. This website will allow users to register themselves for an account, login to that account and logout of that account. Other features of the page include a contact us page, where users can send a message to the administrators where they send their email as well for further conversations if needed.
## User Management
A user can register themselves to make an account on the website, once a user has been registered, they have the ability to login and logout of the website as they please. 

Users will have names, their date of birth, access level and hashed password stored in the website.

There are two access levels for this website, administrator and user, administrator has the ability to change the website, whereas users can only see the website and make no changes.

The user's account password will be stored as a hashed password, meaning no one will know the password of a user except for that user. 
## Product Management
Administrators of the website can add, remove or edit the products of the website. Each product will have a name, a price, and a photo of the product.
